This article is a lie:
Artic sea ice is up 60% from last year because last year was the lowest it has ever been. This years sea ice coverage was still waaay lower than the average. Just because one year happens to better than the last does not mean that the ice cap still isn't shrinking, it just means it had a good year. Look at the trends (from actual scientific literature), you'll see this.

Secondly, ICPP didn't hold a crisis meeting. That's a straight up lie. They even said to David Rose that they would not be holding any meetings, especially not in response to one of his articles. He still chose to lie and say that they did though, shows the reliability of this guy.

Thirdly, global warming is still in effect. There has been no cooling. You can see the data, the literature, from all across the globe. 

I know climate change is a widely debated topic, but if all the evidence against global warming is this, then you're in serious trouble. Look at the science, not the media.
