They?re sitting in a workshop north of the city, thinly carpeted concrete, cracked leather couches, sawdusty workbench strewn with hardware, couple of laptops and monitors for various metrics, soldering iron and bits of solder, wires, cables with ends that don?t fit any contemporary hardware. It?s the abode of a guy called Jed, who works for them. Business Card?s with them ? actually his name?s Steve, clean cut boring office coffee type, grey skin, dark eyebags, you know the one. Saul has only just been introduced to Jed and Steve, and Ace claims not to have recognised them, nor they him.
