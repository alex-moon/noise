Billy wakes before Saul does, in a tiny room just outside city centre, cigarette stained white carpet and white-painted brick walls. He?s lying on the floor disturbingly close to the tiny white gas heater, against a white-painted board, between bedsit and toilet, doesn?t quite reach the floor. The floor is strewn with black overclothes, trying to fill his head with coats and jumpers, jeans, before ashen hangover can get in but oooh not quick enough, oooooooough? Saul?s snoring oblivious and Billy?s seriously considering drinking out of that toilet. Fuck this. Raises his body to leaning and pulls on the nearest torso and trousers, rifles through the clothing for cash and finds the last of Saul?s wad in a coat pocket.
