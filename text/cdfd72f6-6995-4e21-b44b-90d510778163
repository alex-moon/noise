The stranger takes her hand and guides her from the room, her friends on the sofa cheering, sounds of high-fives and laughter. He takes her to one of the bedrooms, reeking of mould and cheap deoderant, walls plastered with naked girls, trash a foot deep on the floor, and nudges her toward the bed, and she knows what to do, done this enough times to do it automatically, removing her skirt, her panties, falling onto the bed legs spread, playing with her breasts while he removes his shoes, his jeans, his underwear, doesn?t even bother with the shirt, moving in, moving to her, moving into her, taking as much into his hands as he can, with an urgency, he will never return, it?s soon over.
