He?s forgotten where he?s going, but it doesn?t matter, all the stations are connected, pick one that looks nice and whip out that piece of paper again. Standing at a rail map, stoned brain trying to remember which part of the address he?s looking for, looking up at the map, then back at the paper, then at the map again, no connections as yet, but blinks a number of times and a few more times and lowers the paper with a sniffle and a glance to his left and to his right, then looks at the map again. Then he looks at the paper again and it comes: north? west? yes, roughly? here! Finger on the station as he recognises the name, then following the lines back to? where? He looks around for a sign and finds one soon enough, yes, this name also on the map? here! Other finger on the station and, which line connects them? This, this here, this dotted line, yes? this way? legend in one corner politely informs him that he is to take the overground in the direction of? following the line north west? here! This one. OK. Easy.
