Kisses couldn?t tell you where he had his childhood, if you asked him, though he?s sure it must have been this same city, never left, he remembers it all, you see? Yes, just not in terms of Geography; that came later. All he could tell you about his earliest years, if you asked, is a small flat with a man who must have been his father, a strong, a kind, with sad eyes and a fervent, a fighting desire to get the boy schooled, lived with this man in a tiny flat near the top of a complex of what looked like suburban semi-detached houses, but stacked on top of each other, to dizzying heights in levels of communal balconies and elevated walkways? edge on over to the railing and look down and there?s, what, alleyways, courtyards, a street level mulling with people though you?ve never been down there, and nor did he ever, the father pulling him from the railing, ?Get outta that,? shuddering, and takes him over a footbridge to a bus stop on the hill, a higher street level, theirs, the father?s and his, and onto a bus that?ll take them into town where they?ll get off to go shopping and just as the father steps out from behind the bus to cross a vehicle bearing down on the wrong side, no oncoming traffic in its way, you see? Of course, it?ll take him won?t it? Right then and there, just as he?s reaching back to take the boy?s hand ? POOM! ? you don?t forget a sound like that. Even a tiny child knows, well, boy, the sound might be a mistaken identity, a trick of the street, but if it?s not, if the thing is real?
