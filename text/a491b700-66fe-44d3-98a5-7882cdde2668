Thwack! Saul?s hands reach for his aching nose, quick punch to the ribs and he keels, door flies open, seatbelt past his face, and someone grabs him by the hair and drags him out of the car. They pull him into a warehouse under a crane, into the stiff and dusty intimacy of a small room near the front, linoleum floor littered with bolts and pieces of piping. He looks up through the tears in his eyes and a tall blonde man in a makeshift throne of copper swims into view. He can?t take it that seriously.
