Saul wakes sick and surrounded by limp bodies of strangers, four in the morning, damp corner of the carpet, no way he?s getting back to sleep, scolls that Black Douglas, rolls a very thick, very well spun J, gets the fuck outta there, looking behind him at intervals, slows only out of sight of landmarks, lights that J in the next suburb; breathes in, breathes out; the sun?s light has turned the sky grey, shadow of the moment of white, disc itself over the rooftops. The city is waking, garbage trucks and street sweepers and occasional bird calls, pale faces of dawn stubbled and wrapped in black wool.
