She turns and starts to remove her skirt while he deals frantically with the laces, trousers around his knees, eyes off her ass just long enough to get the shoes off his feet, and he looks back at a bare ass, everything below the waist gone in one swoop, peering into the gap between her thighs as she bends to flick the skirt, the trousers, following the lines of her underwear on the skin. Then she turns, and her pussy is before him, so close he can smell it. She takes one side of his head in her palm, and he rises. The bed, in each other?s hands, a place where we forget the rules of disengagement, forget who we are, and touch, only touch, smells of our bodies and bedsheets rising like fantasies into the touch of experienced hands, a place where only fantasies reside. Here there is only a crackling of associations, breaking out in waves along the inside of your skull and down your spine, back, all the way back, back to the groins alive with heat and inseperable, two points separated by an arc bending, two points coming to coincide. At the point of intersection a tremor traces the dimensions outward in fantasmatic geometry, places you didn?t know about until you entered. ?Pull out, OK? Pull out,? she says.
