Next thing he remembers, our Kilroy, he?s in a home, or even that?s saying too much, some kind of loosely organised community, youth outreach thing, brick and concrete corners and sad trees, kids you?ve known somehow for years now, though damned if you can recall any of those years. Alcohol was strictly forbidden, but all the kids smoked Pot. The adults knew it happened, and if they caught you? well, not much would happen to be honest. This is how Kisses first got close to Ace. One or the other of ?em, one of the days where his memories fade in, invited the other to share a joint in the courtyard. They were caught red-handed by this big, black Muslim called Dane (pronounced ?Danny?) ? but now what you?ve gotta understand, Kisses?ll cut the story off here to explain, is that Dane was his second, or even his first, great father figure, you see? An infinitely patient man with a voice like an enormous bronze bell, ringing in the snow, you know the one ? and he?s fixed the boys in his gaze, shoulders stooping, and shaken his head, and just not going anywhere, you know? Just stood there staring, no-one?s saying a damned thing, and Ace, who?s got the joint at this point, you get the idea he?s gonna try one on, like ?Alright, Dane? Want a pull?? but he can?t even manage that, in the face of that big, bronze, infinitely patient stare, nothing for it, so he drops the thing and presses it out with the sole of his shoe.
