?I got us something a tad stronger if you don?t mind,? Charles with his eyebrows high and his drinks at jaunty angles, Marina?s drunkenness in a race with her resentment for him (she?ll buy the next round), talking up the gig. ?These are the guys who did Battersea Power Station. Oh, that was one for the true believers. Before my time, if you will, but friends of mine were there. You had to climb a forty-foot wall, crawl in through a smashed window. Very dangerous, very illegal, oh! I wish I?d been there. No-one died either.?
