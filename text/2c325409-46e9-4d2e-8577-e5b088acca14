They go back to talking amongst themselves, she can?t hear what they?re saying. The stranger goes off somewhere and then no-one?s watching her. She keeps on dancing for them, trying to think of other sexy things to do, but she can?t really come up with anything, she?s never been good at coming up with anything on her own, they always tell her what to do, they?re always the ones with the ideas. She stops dancing when the tune ends.
