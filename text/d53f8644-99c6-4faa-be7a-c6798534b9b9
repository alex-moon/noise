He?s due to meet a guy in the carpark behind Olsen?s, abandoned furniture manufacturer, grimey redbrick and broken windows, no-one?s changed the signage. The buyer?s an accountant, kinda guy gets paid, takes a jog and a shower, big eyebrows, you know the one, Kisses ain?t even saved the douchebag?s number into his phone, trail of terse SMSs, fucker?s twenty minutes late of course, and Kisses is jonesing for a smoke real bad.
