Saul takes a seat and rests his eye sockets on his palms, keeps breathing. The thought occurs to him that they?re going to make him use the device again, and all at once he feels trapped, stifled like he can?t breathe, gotta keep breathing, never stop breathing, like he wants to jump off that roof, restless like he wants to run, find a flat somewhere where people are talking shit and laughing about others absent, names he doesn?t know, doesn?t have to think about, smoking pot and shooting smack ?til they?re passed out on the floor and the breathing is regular, in, out, breathing in sleep, never stop breathing, feeling like he?s gonna be in this shitty little brick building for the rest of his life and there?s not a damn thing he can do about it.
