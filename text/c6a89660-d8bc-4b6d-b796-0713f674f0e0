Nevertheless I?ll admit the walk to Lisa?s is very nice. We descend an incline overlooking the scrapers on the docks, train line pulling away to the left and into the trees. There?s an absence of signage in this part of town too, sedate house faces easy on the soul, murmer of the world of things normally drowned in the market-calls of commerce, only transactions happen very quietly, discrete handshake and part ways. If we weren?t all so damn professional we?d never have to go into the city at all.
