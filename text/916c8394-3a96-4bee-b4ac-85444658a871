News of this figure was widely reported ? including by Mailonline - on September 8. But on September 10, the NSIDC quietly changed it to 1.38?million sq km (533,000 sq miles) ? and replaced the original document so the old figure no longer shows up on a main Google search. It can now only be found on an old ?cached? page.
