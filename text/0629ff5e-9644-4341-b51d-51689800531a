In Key West owner Doug DeVos steered his team to victory whilst in Miami it was America?s Cup winners and past Match Racing World Champion Ed Baird who was on the helm of Quantum Racing.
Both events delivered a very broad range of weather conditions, from squally rain showers and big gusts in Key West ? as well as typically picture postcard moderate breezes and sunshine ? to a memorable three race day in boisterous 22-30kts conditions in Miami. Hence the final hierarchy ranking after the two events can be considered very representative.
