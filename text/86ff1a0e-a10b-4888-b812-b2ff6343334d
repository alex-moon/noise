Personally it is was so nice for us as a team to win the US 52 SUPER SERIES. It is as near to a ?home game? as we see. It was absolutely perfect from the Quantum Racing standpoint. Miami, our crew agreed, was the best they have ever sailed. There was not an incredibly dominant performance it was very close all the time.
