What is it about cigarettes that?s so friendly, makes a guy go up to a stranger in the street and say, ?Oy,? pronounced almost like, ?Oh yes,? like he?s just remembered or just noticed and, ?don?t suppose you could spare a fag?? Something about the parting of the lips to receive, as a kiss, I?m sure that?s what it is, every poisonous lip stick a kiss, lost but not, by the body at least, forgotten, kisses; kisses, kisses.
