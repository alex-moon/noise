?But huge volumes of text,? Jed says, ?scraped from the Web ? tweets, Facebook status updates, blog posts, cruft ?n? all, ?three hours ago, like this, share on Reddit,? all o? that shite, unfiltered and apparently at random. I did a text search for anything about a Charles and a Marina at a Warehouse party ? nothing. Oh these words appeared, thousands, millions of times, ?Marina,? ?Charles,? ?Warehouse,? ?Battersea Power Station,? ?Camden.? But disparate, scattered, nothing as coherent as a story.?
