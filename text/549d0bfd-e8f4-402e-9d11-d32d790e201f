The boat was always fast in Miami in all conditions there. We did not sail perfectly tactically, no one did and no one really could, it is that type of venue. It was about minimising risks and we did well. I have never seen our team so pumped up about winning a regatta, that reflects how hard it was and how well they sailed.
