The train rolls out through the villages sparsening, stopping at each in turn, and into the off-green countryside where the clouds are clearing and the houses have coloured walls. Soon he has a seat. The land rolls immense by him and he feels his own tiny weight in the softness in the seat, and watches alternately his dim reflection and the vivid rolling land. The sun is well up in the sky. Animals are moving in the fields. There are windfarms and haycarts, cobbled village squares faintly muddy and lined with expensive cars, Bentleys, Aston Martins, Rolls Royces, all black.
