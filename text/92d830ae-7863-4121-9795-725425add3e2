They make their way into the depth of the crowd by degrees. From corrugated tin wall to wall dark figures punctuated by glowing points in pink and green and yellow, Post-It colours, here and there a hoodie or hairstyle worth mentioning, but the greater part pragmatic material, black, with those punctuations, prints in white, yellow, green, pink, sunset colours. The music is a driving kick with few elaborations, and over it a rolling sea of reverb in minor chords, and under both a lilting subbass like folksong from the bottom of the sea. Everyone?s waiting to come up, getting limber in preparation. Soon the ciders are gone and Charles is moving melancholy between the people. Here there is no talk and only occasional eyes. What do you look at in this space? The flashes of light? The DJ? Marina looks at Charles.
