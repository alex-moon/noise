 I had no idea that thousands of people were making their own solar panels.  My friend had collected various drawings and "do-it-yourself  ideas" but nothing was very organized and there wasn't anything I could find online that gave me details on how to do it. There were people talking about it, but it wasn't until my friend and I developed GreenDIYenergy   that there was a step-by-step guide on the topic.
