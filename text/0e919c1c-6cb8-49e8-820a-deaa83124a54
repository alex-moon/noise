Marina makes a move to Camden with the intention of meeting her sometime fuckbuddy Charles for a drink before the gig. No-one knows where it is, he?s told her, standard procedure except that she?s not on the guest list, cursing herself for letting him make her dependent. Charles was never the nicest guy, not from meanness or manipulative demeanour, only from a little introspective unawareness of most things and unfeeling.
