Chris Vanderbilt is the first to play, followed by Evelyn, then Anya, and so on, counter-clockwise. Play proceeds in silence for the first few turns, but soon enough someone says something that breaks a rule, and someone penalises the perpetrator, does so in such a way that breaks another rule, is penalised in turn, calls a false accusation, having forgotten the rule in question, play having, meanwhile, continued up to the point where someone?s collecting ?too slow? penalties without realising it, and the volume steadily rises as play degenerates into a storm of cards and drunken laughter until someone accepts the sixteen cards she?s been given, grudgingly, and tops up her wine glass, and the player after her says, ?Bartoq.?
